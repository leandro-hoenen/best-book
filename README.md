## Mission / Initial Goal

The initial goal of the website was to create and build an ecommerce platform that mainly focuses on the buying and selling of used books related to school and/or university in the perspective of potential buyers and sellers. It should be a website where a potential buyer can use the simple interface of the website to browse the listings of books. A seller on the other hand should have the possibility to register and login to upload their books. The payment will happen outside of the website. The website will just work as a general marketplace with the mission to connect buyer and seller and is not liable.

## Problem Statement

Because of the ambitious goal to build an ecommerce website, the development team severely undererstimated the back-end development as well as the seemless integration of the front-end part of the website. In order to successfully deploy the website project as well as maintaining the given deadline, the team decided to cut features of the website and focus on the essential part of the website with the ambition to add the features later on.

## Further Notes

In the code the class customer was not used. However, for the sake of simplicity, it was not deleted.

## Result

Instead of an ecommerce platform with users such as buyers and sellers the team build a website where users can create an account to enter the website and create a collection of their video games, movies and books. Furthermore, users can adjust each collection with the according delete, edit and add buttons. The website serves purely to manage the mentioned collection. With basic use-cases it is possible to expand the website to an ecommerce platform website in the future.
